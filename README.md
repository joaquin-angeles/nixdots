A *modern, extensible* **Hyprland/Wayland** configuration for NixOS that utilizes the **Gruvbox** colorscheme.

These configurations work to deliver a sleek, performant desktop environment built entirely with Nix flakes and Home Manager—fully declarative, reproducible, and easy to customize.

# Features
- Lightweight & Performant

Hyprland is tuned to near-maximum efficiency, ensuring the environment stays out of the way of demanding workloads.

- Near-Complete Daily Driver

Includes everything needed for a functional desktop without bloat:
  - Minimal yet powerful Waybar panel
  - Fast app launcher (Rofi/Wofi)
  - Essential utilities (network: impala/wiremix, Bluetooth: bluetui, etc.)
  - Default browser and core apps

- Outstanding Developer Experience

A fully configured dev setup via Home Manager:
  - Neovim with sensible defaults
  - Zsh + fzf + zoxide + useful aliases
  - Zellij terminal multiplexer
  - And more productivity tools out of the box

- Coherent & Declarative Configuration

Almost everything is managed in pure Nix via Home Manager—no scattered config files in multiple languages.
